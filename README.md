# Access-Control-System-for-COVID-19-SOP-Monitoring

## What is it?

The project includes an access control system designed to monitor the global pandemic COVID’19 standard operating procedure (SOPs) in the public areas or organization. The software should detect a person’s face mask using cameras implemented in public areas, automatic doors, local organizations such as bank, schools and universities. This should not only detect a person face-mask but also sent the information (profile) of the person to the respective organization locally; this will help the organization to take record of the person. The system can be implemented in any pre-installed system as well, such as in pre-installed automatic doors, the system is customizable and can also be added as a feature.

## Implementation:

A desktop application software is developed by the team, the application include the features such as:
1.	User friendly environment 
2.	Face detection
3.	Small size software
4.	User Pro

The user data will be stored in the organization database locally and the cameras all over the organization will be monitored through the AI based software. Once the camera detects a person without mask, it will ping on the monitor and may sent a warning mail to the person as well.
